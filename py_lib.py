# Python Libraries

# We can import methods and functions
# Python has loads of libraries, we can import any of them if we know what we want
# because its opensource, free
# I'ts been around for a long time
# I'ts a simple language,
# I'ts built into the language

# import random     # to import the library random
# print(random.random())


from random import random          # if we don't want the entire library


import math

print(random())     # we don't need to mention where, random because we call it from above


num_float = 23.66

print(math.ceil(num_float))
print(math.floor(num_float))
print(math.pi)
